# CP2077.MrWizard
 Save Editor for Cyberpunk 2077 (in progress).

Work in progress. Primary concern is the Save File bloat, seeing if I can take a stab at fixing it. Then maybe a full fleshed save editor as I break down the contents of the save file.  

Also another major concern is versioning. I already detect byte structure differences between v1.02 and v1.04... so I will need to solve that.  

I am in no rush to work on this, since I am trying to actually play the game.
